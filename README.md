# SyriaTel Customer Churn

SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, is grappling with customer churn, a challenge faced by many businesses in the industry. The pressing issue is the financial impact of customers discontinuing their services, leading to revenue loss and potentially hindering the company's growth. To address this concern, the company seeks to leverage machine learning to build a classifier that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn in the near future. The goal is to identify patterns and factors contributing to customer attrition, enabling proactive retention strategies.

A few visualisations were also given to give a quick insight into how some of the features would relate with each other as seen below.
